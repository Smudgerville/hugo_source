## Welcome

This is my github hosted static site.

The goal is to share resources and learning publicly.  

Highlight [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob) [post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/)

After teaching, made me realize that sharing publicly holds me to a higher standard.

Areas mainly focused on statistical analysis & forecasting with R.
