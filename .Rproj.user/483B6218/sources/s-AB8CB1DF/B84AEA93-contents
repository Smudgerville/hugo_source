## Hello, World!

Welcome to the site.  This isn't intended to be anything too formal but rather a place to share resources and learn publicly.  

For many years, I have tried my best to organize my thoughts, notes, and learning in various ways.  Unsurprisingly, most of these efforts have remained untouched since the day I made them.  Mostly inspired by an excellent [post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) by [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob), I hope to hold myself to a slightly higher standard of organization and quality by making more things public.  

One point that I'd like to note up front is that my goal in adding content here is not to write about areas or topics with which I feel comfortable.  I'd really like to *learn out loud* so to speak by describing topics and areas I'm discovering.  As always though, there is an exception...

One area that I have spent a good amount of time in my professional life that I do aim to write about is Time Series Forecasting.  I recently lectured at a local university and while I felt that I had a good understanding of the subject personally, I frequently felt that I did a poor job of conveying this to others.  I do feel that this is an area where simple and clear resources will be helpful but I will also likely be irked by my inability to communicate these concepts until I more clearly outline my thoughts!

At the time of writing, my work and interests focus on forecasting, analytics and statistical methods with a focus on the energy industry.  I anticipate that content will likely align with these broad topics but I'll see where the learning takes me!

Please don't hesitate to [contact me](../#contact) with any questions, thoughts or comments.
