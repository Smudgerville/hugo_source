## Overview

The aim of this post is to describe how to get up and running with a static site using [Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  All of these tools make it fantastically easy to build a quality website quickly and easily.

We will use two git repositories, one to build the site and another to publish in a format that allows the site to be statically hosted with github pages.

### Understanding the Tools

- **Blogdown:** An open-source (GPL-3) R package to generate static websites based on R Markdown and Hugo.

  - **Hugo:**  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is an open-source static site generator.

  - **R Studio:**  [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

- **Github Pages:**  Free hosting for your static site direct from your github repository.


## Instructions

### Prerequisites & Dependencies

- A Github account.  Sign up at https://github.com/
- R.  Download from https://cran.r-project.org/
- R Studio.  Download from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/

###  Step By Step

1.  Initialize a github repo.  This must be empty to start a new blogdown site.
2.  Open terminal at location
3.  `git clone <repo name>`
  - Delete anything if for some reason it isn't blank.
4.  Set up repo for github.io static site

**username.github.io**

If for example your github username was *krieger*, your repo would need to be *krieger.github.io*

5.  Clone your newly created *username.github.io* site
6.  Open R Studio, install blogdown & hugo:

`install.packages("blogdown")`

`blogdown::install_hugo()`

7.  Start an R Studio Project in the folder of the first repo you cloned locally (**not** the .github.io one)
  - To use a theme other than the defaul one, check out some of the resources here:  [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/).  
  - I chose the Academic theme which comes with specific instructions to [install with R Studio](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/#install-with-rstudio)
  - I also created with sample blog posts for hints on syntax & then deleted these later
8.  Edit config.toml
  - Add: `publishDir = ""`
  - Change the path for you `publishDir` variable to the locally cloned .github.io repo.  This should be an absolute path or relative to the config.toml file the variable is included in.  
  - This variable publishes the static site contents to the .gihub.io repo so github static host it.  

`blogdown::new_post(title = "Welcome to my site", ext = ".Rmd")`

9.  With the Academic theme, I had to remove `hero.md` from the following location: blogdown > Content > Home
  - This was the theme resources and description that loads at the top of your site otherwise.
