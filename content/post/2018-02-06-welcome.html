<div id="welcome" class="section level2">

<p>This is my github hosted static site.</p>
<p>The goal is to share resources and learning publicly.</p>
<p>Highlight <a href="https://twitter.com/drob">David Robinson</a> <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">post</a></p>
<p>After teaching, made me realize that sharing publicly holds me to a higher standard.</p>
<p>Areas mainly focused on statistical analysis &amp; forecasting with R.</p>
