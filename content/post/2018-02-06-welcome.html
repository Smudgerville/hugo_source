<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
<p>Welcome to the site. This isn’t intended to be anything too formal but rather a place to share resources and learn publicly.</p>
<p>For many years, I have tried my best to organize my thoughts, notes, and learning in various ways. Unsurprisingly, most of these efforts have remained untouched since the day I made them. Mostly inspired by an excellent <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/drob">David Robinson</a>, I hope to hold myself to a slightly higher standard of organization and quality by making more things public.</p>
<p>One point that I’d like to note up front is that my goal in adding content here is not to write about areas or topics with which I feel comfortable. I’d really like to <em>learn out loud</em> so to speak by describing topics and areas I’m discovering. As always though, there is an exception…</p>
<p>One area that I have spent a good amount of time in my professional life that I do aim to write about is Time Series Forecasting. I recently lectured at a local university and while I felt that I had a good understanding of the subject personally, I frequently felt that I did a poor job of conveying this to others. I do feel that this is an area where simple and clear resources will be helpful but I will also likely be irked by my inability to communicate these concepts until I more clearly outline my thoughts!</p>
<p>At the time of writing, my work and interests focus on forecasting, analytics and statistical methods with a focus on the energy industry. I anticipate that content will likely align with these broad topics but I’ll see where the learning takes me!</p>
<p>Please don’t hesitate to <a href="../#contact">contact me</a> with any questions, thoughts or comments.</p>
